I like board games, I also wanted to learn Java and how to make an Android application. I decided to combine those and make an app that would allow the user to roll virtual dice. Not only that, but you could create your own custom dice. If you wanted to roll 3 dice that all have even numbers between 50 and 100 who are also multiples of 7, you can. You also can make dice using words. Loss that special dice for that card game you like? You can create a virtual one. Canâ€™t decide which restaurant you want to eat at? Put each one in the list and let it randomly pick one for you.
